    <h3>The History of Opera</h3> 
    <!--first subheading-->
    <p>Opera originated in western europe in the 17th century. Initially, it was a form of entertainment only accessible to those occupying the French and Italian royal palaces. Then, in the 18th century is when opera really took off and spread across europe. Two main branches resulted from this expansion-opera seria and opera buffa. Opera seria was sung in the rhythm of natrual speech, expressing emotion through a solo voice. Meanwhile, opera buffa translates to comic opera-meant for laughter. Additionally, this expansion brought the rise of Mozart. Commonly referred to as the greatest composer of all time, Mozart began writing music at just 3 years old. He was a shild prodigy, yet as he grew-like many geniuses-his talent was no longer recognized. </p> <!--history of opera info-->
    <h3>Modern Opera</h3> 
    <!--second subheading-->
    <p>The modern opera is still only frequented by the elites in society. It is tradition to them, and can represent social status. Orfeo by Monteverdi is the first recognizable opera, and it is still performed today.</p> <!--modern opera info-->
